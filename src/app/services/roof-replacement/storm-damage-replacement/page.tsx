            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-dark-blue mb-6">Idaho Weather Is Tough on Roofs</h2>
            <p>The Treasure Valley gets it all—hail storms in summer, high winds year-round, and heavy snow loads in winter. Any of these can damage your roof enough to require replacement.</p>

            <p>If your roof was damaged in a recent storm, you're probably covered by homeowner's insurance. We help homeowners navigate the claims process and restore their roofs properly.</p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-dark-blue mb-6 mt-12">Common Storm Damage</h2>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-dark-blue mb-4 mt-8">Hail Damage</h3>
            <p>Hail is one of the most common causes of roof damage in Idaho. Even pea-sized hail can bruise shingles and reduce their lifespan.</p>

            <p>Signs of hail damage:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Dents or bruises on shingle surfaces</li>
              <li>Granule loss exposing black asphalt underneath</li>
              <li>Cracked or broken shingles</li>
              <li>Damage to roof vents, skylights, and flashing</li>
              <li>Dents on metal components like gutters and vents</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Hail damage isn't always obvious from the ground. A professional inspection is the only way to know for sure.</p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-dark-blue mb-4 mt-8">Wind Damage</h3>
            <p>Idaho gets strong winds that can lift and tear shingles, especially on older roofs or poorly installed roofing.</p>

            <p>Wind damage includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Missing shingles or sections of roofing</li>
              <li>Lifted or creased shingles</li>
              <li>Torn or damaged flashing</li>
              <li>Exposed underlayment or deck</li>
              <li>Debris impacts from wind-blown objects</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-dark-blue mb-4 mt-8">Snow and Ice Damage</h3>
            <p>Heavy snow loads and ice dams can cause serious problems, especially on older roofs.</p>

            <p>Common winter damage:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sagging or structural damage from snow weight</li>
              <li>Ice dam leaks causing interior water damage</li>
              <li>Icicle damage to gutters and eaves</li>
              <li>Freeze-thaw cycles causing shingle deterioration</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-dark-blue mb-6 mt-12">Free Storm Damage Inspection</h2>
            <p>After major storms, we provide free roof inspections to assess damage.</p>

            <p>During the inspection, we:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Check all roof slopes and surfaces</li>
              <li>Inspect flashing, vents, and roof penetrations</li>
              <li>Look for interior signs of leaks or damage</li>
              <li>Document all damage with detailed photos</li>
              <li>Provide a written assessment</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If we find damage, we'll explain what needs to be replaced and whether it's likely covered by insurance.</p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-dark-blue mb-6 mt-12">Working with Insurance Companies</h2>
            <p>We've handled hundreds of insurance claims for storm damage. We know what adjusters look for and how to document damage properly.</p>

            <p>Our insurance assistance includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Detailed documentation</strong> - Photos and notes of all damage</li>
              <li><strong>Adjuster meetings</strong> - We'll meet with your insurance adjuster on-site</li>
              <li><strong>Comprehensive estimates</strong> - Detailed scope of work in the format insurers require</li>
              <li><strong>Supplement requests</strong> - If initial approval is insufficient, we document additional damage</li>
              <li><strong>Direct billing options</strong> - We can work directly with your insurance company</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Your insurance company works for their bottom line. We work for you to ensure all damage is properly documented and covered.</p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-dark-blue mb-6 mt-12">The Claims Process</h2>
            <p>Here's how a typical storm damage claim works:</p>

            <ol>
              <li><strong>Call us for inspection</strong> - We assess damage and document it</li>
              <li><strong>File your claim</strong> - Contact your insurance company to open a claim</li>
              <li><strong>Adjuster inspection</strong> - Insurance sends an adjuster to assess damage</li>
              <li><strong>We meet the adjuster</strong> - Show them all damage and advocate for proper scope</li>
              <li><strong>Approval and payment</strong> - Insurance approves claim and issues payment</li>
              <li><strong>Schedule replacement</strong> - We schedule your roof replacement</li>
              <li><strong>Completion</strong> - Install new roof and provide final documentation</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-dark-blue mb-6 mt-12">Don't Wait Too Long</h2>
            <p>Most insurance policies require you to file storm damage claims within one year of the damage. Don't wait too long after a major storm.</p>

            <p>Also, leaving storm damage unaddressed can lead to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Water leaks and interior damage</li>
              <li>Mold growth from moisture intrusion</li>
              <li>Further deterioration of damaged shingles</li>
              <li>Additional damage in the next storm</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-dark-blue mb-6 mt-12">Beware of Storm Chasers</h2>
            <p>After major storms, out-of-state contractors flood the area looking for quick jobs. Many do subpar work and disappear before warranty issues arise.</p>

            <p>Choose a local, established contractor who:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Has a permanent local presence</li>
              <li>Will be around to honor warranties</li>
              <li>Has verifiable local references</li>
              <li>Is properly licensed and insured in Idaho</li>
            </ul>
